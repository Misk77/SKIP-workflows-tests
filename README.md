# SKIP-workflows-tests

If we adding in the header the [skip ci] will be implemented for the whole PR and the PUSH/MERGE
BUT
If we only adding in the mcommit message, it wil only affecting the PR, but it will run the PUSH/merge

So best and most secure way is to adding in the HEADER - first commit message
